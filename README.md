# alien-waves
simple 2d shooter game implemented in processing (a Java framework for simple visual programs)

this is a simple game I made when I was TA'ing for game programming course at UMD. 
Enemies (various 2D geometric shapes) are falling down and player needs to hit them with different bullet types (point, line segment, sphere). 

So this simple game demonstrates: a game loop + many types of collision checks in 2D.

here's a demo of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slwXkHRJ_bo

to run the game, run AlienWaves file on Processing
